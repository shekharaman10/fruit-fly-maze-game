"""The determinism gates, on the GPU.

Skipped when CUDA is unavailable, so CI and CPU-only machines stay green.

A GPU backend is only worth having if it keeps the property the whole piece
rests on. Speed that costs bit-identity is worse than no speed at all, because
the six instances would decorrelate from arithmetic rather than from heat and
the result would look like success.
