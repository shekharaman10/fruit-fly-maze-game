"""Overnight parameter sweep.

    python scripts/sweep.py --hours 7 --out runs/sweep

Runs the simulation across a grid of compulsion and button parameters, writing
one run per combination plus a summary table, so the morning is a matter of
picking a configuration rather than guessing at one.

Every parameter here was chosen by hand in a single evening, mostly by eye:
grip, debt_bias, contrast, habituation and escalation rates. None has been
explored. That is what this is for.

Results are appended to sweep.csv as each run finishes, so an interrupted
sweep still leaves usable data. The laptop may sleep, throttle or be closed;
none of that corrupts what is already written.

# The grid. Kept small deliberately: a 3s run is about 14 minutes measured on
# this machine, so 36 combinations is roughly 8.4 hours. Better to explore a
# few axes properly than to sample a large space once each. Runs are ordered
# outward from the best known configuration, so stopping early still leaves
# the useful part explored.
# switch-margin is first because it is the parameter that decides whether the
# piece reads at all. Below about 0.2 the three unheld chambers braid together
# at mid-range and only two of five move; see docs/negative-results.md. The
# range here brackets the 0.40 chosen by replay, which was measured against
# recorded operator spikes and needs confirming in closed loop.
