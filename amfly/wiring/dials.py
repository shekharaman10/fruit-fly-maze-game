"""Five dials, not one switch.

The operator does not choose which chamber is heated. It sets how much, for each
of the five, continuously. Every chamber is always being heated by some amount.
Nothing is ever off.

Each of the five descending-neuron blocks drives one chamber's level directly:
block 0 busy means chamber 0 climbs, block 0 quiet means chamber 0 falls. The
five move independently, so all five can be high at once, or all low, or any mix.

This replaces the single-selection dial in operator.py. Two reasons.

The first is the piece. A switch is a choice made once. Five levels held
continuously is an ongoing act with nothing ever off the hook, and the five
chambers are not taking turns, they are all being adjusted forever by something
that does not know they exist.

The second is measurement. Only a continuously heated chamber accumulated any
real divergence: chamber 0 reached a cumulative distance of 43.5 million over
13,637 uninterrupted steps, while chambers heated in blocks of 2,805 peaked at a
single neuron. See docs/negative-results.md. Under one switch, four chambers sit
cold at any moment and never accumulate. Under five dials they all do.

As before: the operator reads only its own spikes, never the chambers. It gets
no feedback. There is no RNG anywhere in this file.
