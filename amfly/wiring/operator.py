"""The sixth fly, and the dial.

The operator is not special. Same graph, same weights, same parameters as the
five in the chambers. It differs only in where it sits in the wiring: its
descending-neuron activity is read out and used to point a dial, and the dial
selects which chamber gets heated.

It receives no feedback. It never sees the chambers, and nothing about their
state reaches it. Indifference rather than cruelty.

The readout is a fixed rule, not a trained decoder. Partition the 1,314
descending neurons into 5 contiguous blocks by sorted bodyId, count spikes per
block in a sliding window, point at the argmax. Ties break to the lowest index.
Nothing is learned, nothing is randomised, and the mapping can be audited by
reading this file.

The partition is arbitrary and is declared as such. Measured: the five blocks
hold 263, 263, 263, 263 and 262 DNs and span 181, 183, 142, 81 and 180 distinct
DN types respectively, so no block is a single functional group and the mapping
carries no anatomical claim. It is a legible rule for turning one fly's
descending activity into a choice of five, nothing more. Reading it as "block 3
is the escape pathway" would be wrong.
