"""Five sealed chambers, and the heat.

Heat is delivered as sustained depolarising current into the thermoreceptor
neurons of exactly one chamber at a time, matching the sustained firing of fly
warm cells above about 25C.

The isolation property lives here and is enforced structurally: `injection()`
writes into exactly one column of the (N, n_instances) matrix. The operator
column is never written. There is no code path by which heating chamber 3 can
touch chamber 1, which is what makes Gate 2 a real test rather than a hopeful
assertion.

Targets are TRN_VP* (25 bodies). There are no neurons of type "AC" in this
dataset despite the literature naming anterior cell thermoreceptors, so an AC
lookup returns nothing at all and would leave the heat channel silently dead.

class Electrode:

    Replaces ContinuousHeat, and the change is not cosmetic.

    Heat implied cooking, which this model cannot represent: there is no
    tissue damage, no nociception, and nothing that degrades. A neuron here
    integrates input and spikes and cannot be injured. See
    docs/what-heat-is.md.

    What the simulation literally does is inject millivolts of depolarising
    current. That was always the mechanism; heat was an interpretive layer on
    top of it. Millivolts is the real unit, so an electrode is the more honest
    description rather than the more lurid one.

    Two things make this defensible where the heat channel was not:

    **It has a position.** Every neuron is stimulated in proportion to its
    distance from the electrode tip, on a Gaussian falloff, which is what a
    real electrode does. Nothing is selected by cell type, so there is no "why
    those neurons?" to answer. The thermoreceptors it replaces had no soma
    coordinates at all, 0 of 25, because they are afferents whose cell bodies
    sit in the periphery: the old channel could not have been placed even in
    principle.

    **It is discrete.** Real stimulation is delivered as pulses, not as a
    held level. The chamber level now sets how OFTEN a chamber is pulsed
    rather than how hard, so a chamber at full is being hit constantly and one
    at 20% is hit occasionally. Amplitude per pulse is fixed, which is also
    how a stimulator is used.

    Isolation is unchanged and still structural: this writes chamber columns
    only and never the operator's.
