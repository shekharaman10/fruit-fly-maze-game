"""The operator is not indifferent. It is trapped.

This replaces the original design, in which the operator never received
anything from the chambers. `project.md` chose indifference over cruelty, and
that version was honest: the isolation was enforced in code and tested.

This version is worse for the operator and better as a piece. It is given a
reason to keep the chambers hot, and it cannot satisfy all five:

  - It can only hold TWO dials at a time. The other three drift down.
  - Driving any chamber to 100% stimulates its own reward circuit.
  - Any chamber that falls below half heats the operator, through its own
    thermoreceptors, exactly as the chambers are heated.

So it rushes between five dials it cannot all hold, rewarded for the one it
reaches and punished for the four it does not. The sixth fly is not the one
outside the cage; it is the one that cannot stop.

Both inputs are real measured circuits, not invented ones:

  - Reward: 340 dopaminergic neurons (PAM 316, PPL1 16, PPL2 8) acting on the
    mushroom body, 4,064 Kenyon cells and 97 MBONs. This is the fly's actual
    reinforcement pathway.
  - Punishment: the operator's own TRN_VP thermoreceptors, the same 25 cells
    heated in every chamber.

What is authored, and must be said plainly in the README:

  - The two-dial limit is a rule of the piece, not a property of the fly.
  - The 100% and 50% thresholds are chosen.
  - Stimulating PAM is not the same as the fly wanting anything. It is current
    injected into neurons that participate in reinforcement learning. Nothing
    here experiences reward, and the README must not imply otherwise.
