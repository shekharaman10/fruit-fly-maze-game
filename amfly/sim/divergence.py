"""Measuring how far apart the instances have drifted.

Population rate is the wrong observable and the first run proved it: chamber 0
diverged in *which* neurons fired while the total count stayed identical, so a
rate trace showed six lines on top of each other and hid the entire subject of
the piece. See docs/negative-results.md.

What actually matters is spike identity. Two instances are the same only while
the same neurons fire at the same step.

`hamming` is the honest measure and it is cheap: one XOR over the boolean spike
matrix per step, no allocation of the full history.
