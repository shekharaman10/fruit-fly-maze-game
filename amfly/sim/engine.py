"""Six instances of one connectome, batched as six columns.

The central design claim: six instances cost near-nothing over one, and
bit-identity between them is STRUCTURAL rather than something we tune for.

Both properties come from the same decision. State is (N, 6). Every step does
one `csr @ state` with a fixed reduction order, so all six columns are reduced
in the same order by the same code path. There is no per-instance kernel, no
atomic accumulation, and no spike-order dependence anywhere.

We deliberately use the deterministic pull model even though it reads the whole
matrix each step. project.md says "event-driven propagation is not optional".
That was written for a realtime target and it is wrong here: a push kernel with
atomics accumulates in non-deterministic order, which would decorrelate the six
from floating-point noise alone and produce a convincing fake of the exact
phenomenon this piece is about. Offline, we do not need the speed.
