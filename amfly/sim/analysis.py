"""Reading a finished run.

The question this answers is the one the plan flagged as a risk: does the heated
chamber stay separated, or does it fall back into step with the others?

Re-convergence would be a real finding rather than a bug. A deterministic
network settling back onto the same trajectory after a perturbation is a
statement about the connectome, and per the README register it gets published
either way rather than quietly reframed.
